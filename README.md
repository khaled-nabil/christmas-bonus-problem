# Problem
An HR manager responsible for 1000 employees numbered from 1 to 1000. Your boss told you to give a big Christmas bonus to employees, but didnâ€™t tell you their names. Instead they gave you two indications:                                      
 1) the sum of the proper divisors (including 1 but not itself) of the employee number is greater than the employee number itself
 2) no subset of those divisors sums to the employee number itself.
